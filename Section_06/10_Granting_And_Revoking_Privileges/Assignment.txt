-- acting as user "Taz" which has access to the Products table

-- Taz grants SELECT privilege to user U3
GRANT SELECT ON Products TO U3

-- U3 can do the following now
SELECT * FROM Taz.Products;

-- Taz grants more privileges
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE ON Products TO U4,U3;

-- Taz revokes privileges
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE ON Products FROM U4,U3;

-- Taz creates a role
Create ROLE r1;

-- Taz grants privileges (P1, P2, P3) to a role (r1)
GRANT P1, P2, P3 TO r1;

-- Taz assigns user to a role
ALTER USER U3 
DEFAULT ROLE r1;

-- Know what your schema/user is / doesn't work in apex (due to restrictions)
SHOW USER;

-- To achieve the SHOW USER result in apex
SELECT sys_context('userenv', 'current_schema')
FROM dual;
